# Tangible User Interface Project

## Project Overview
This project introduces a **Tangible User Interface (TUI)** concept, primarily designed for dual-screen users. The goal is to make controlling media content on platforms like YouTube more intuitive and efficient while performing tasks such as coding or working on another screen. The interface allows users to control video playback through both **physical buttons** (using an Arduino) and **hand gestures** (using a webcam).

### Key Features:
- **Button Control:** Users can control video functions like play/pause, mute/unmute, fullscreen on/off using physical buttons.
- **Hand Gesture Control:** By utilizing hand gestures detected through a webcam, users can skip forward/backward (5 seconds) and navigate to the next or previous videos.

This simple beginner-level project combines **Arduino** and **Python** to create a dual-mode media control system. It is designed for users who multitask between watching tutorial videos and working on other tasks, making video control seamless without needing to switch between windows constantly.

## Limitations
- The system currently only supports basic video functions.
- Hand gesture detection might be less accurate in low-light conditions or with fast movements.
- Button control may feel limited, as only three basic buttons are used for functionalities.

## Future Work
1. **Volume Control with Physical Knob:** Integrating a **rotary encoder** (similar to a fan regulator) for adjusting volume levels.
2. **Improved Gesture Detection:** Enhancing hand gesture recognition for better accuracy and adding more gestures (e.g., volume control, timeline navigation).
3. **Additional Button Functionality:** Incorporating more buttons for more advanced media control, such as controlling video speed or interacting with playlists.
