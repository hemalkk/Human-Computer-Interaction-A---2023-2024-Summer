# Tangible User Interface Project - Requirements and Setup

## Hardware Requirements:
- **Arduino Uno R3**: Microcontroller board used to handle the physical buttons.
- **Jumper Wires (Male-to-Male)**: Used to connect the buttons to the Arduino.
- **3 Push Buttons**: These are used for controlling the play/pause, mute/unmute, and fullscreen functionalities. Although on/off buttons were used initially, push buttons are more suitable for this type of control.
- **Webcam**: A webcam is used for capturing hand gestures for gesture-based control.

## Software Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**: The main programming language for the gesture recognition and YouTube control.
- **Arduino IDE**: To upload the button control code to the Arduino Uno R3.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `opencv-python`: For handling webcam input and video processing.
  - `mediapipe`: For hand gesture recognition.
  - `pyserial`: For serial communication between Python and Arduino.
  - `pyautogui`: To simulate keyboard inputs for controlling YouTube.

## Installation Steps:

### Step 1: Set up Arduino Uno
1. Connect the **push buttons** to the Arduino Uno R3 using **jumper wires**.
2. Use the **Arduino IDE** to upload the button control code to the Arduino.
3. Make sure the Arduino is connected to your computer via USB.

### Step 2: Install Python and Required Libraries
1. Install **Python 3.x** on your computer.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyserial pyautogui
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Project
1. Connect your **webcam** and ensure it is functional.
2. Run the **Python code** that controls the hand gesture recognition.
3. Open YouTube in your browser and use either **hand gestures** or **physical buttons** to control the video.
