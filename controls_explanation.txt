# Tangible User Interface Project - Controls Explanation

## Button Controls:
This project uses three physical buttons connected to the Arduino for controlling YouTube video playback:

- **Button 1**: Play/Pause the video
- **Button 2**: Mute/Unmute the video
- **Button 3**: Toggle Full Screen on/off

### Button Wiring:
- **Button 1 (Play/Pause)** is connected to Arduino's digital pin **2**.
- **Button 2 (Mute/Unmute)** is connected to Arduino's digital pin **3**.
- **Button 3 (Full Screen)** is connected to Arduino's digital pin **4**.
- The **C (Common)** terminal of each button is connected to these pins, while the **NC (Normally Closed)** terminal is connected to Arduino's **GND** through a **breadboard**.

## Hand Gesture Controls:
The project also incorporates hand gesture control via a webcam for additional media playback functions:

- **Forward 5 seconds**: Swipe your hand to the right.
- **Backward 5 seconds**: Swipe your hand to the left.
- **Next Video**: A long swipe to the right.
- **Previous Video**: A long swipe to the left.

## Recognized Gestures:
--Short Swipe (forward/backward): If the pinky is to the left of the thumb, it simulates a "right arrow" key press to skip forward 5 seconds, and if it's to the right, it simulates a "left arrow" key press to go back 5 seconds.
--Long Swipe (next/previous video): If the index finger is far from the wrist and the pinky is to the left of the thumb, it simulates the "next video" (shift + N) or "previous video" (shift + P) action.

These gestures are detected using the webcam and controlled via the Python script.
